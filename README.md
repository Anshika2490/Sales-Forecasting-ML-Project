# Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning

A Machine Learning project for sales forecasting using Python, Pandas, and multiple ML and visualization libraries.  
This project experiments with different algorithms and preprocessing techniques to identify the most accurate model for predicting future sales trends.

## Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales using data-driven methods.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and model comparison to achieve reliable predictions.

### Objectives
- Understand sales patterns and seasonal trends  
- Clean and preprocess the raw data  
- Apply feature engineering for better prediction quality  
- Train and compare multiple ML models  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE  
- Visualize results for business insights

# Workflow Summary

1. Data Collection and Exploration
   - Loaded dataset and explored key features
   - Checked for missing values and data distribution

2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handled missing data
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Normalized and transformed numerical columns

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Used visualizations to identify sales trends and correlations
   - Plotted seasonal and time-based trends

4. Model Building and Comparison
   - Trained multiple models (Random Forest, LightGBM, etc.)
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal results
   - Compared model performance

5. Results and Evaluation
   - Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy and RMSE
   - Visualized actual vs predicted sales values

6. Results Highlights
   - LightGBM outperformed other models with the lowest RMSE and highest accuracy.
   - Achieved approximately 15% improvement over baseline models.
   - Generated visual insights highlighting key sales trends and influential factors.
